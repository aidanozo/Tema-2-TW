# Presentation site for an NGO

## Story

It's always a great thing to help others. 
Maybe you're already helping out in a dog shelter, 
handing out food for people in need, collecting used cloth for charities or 
separate garbage to keep our planet clean. All little matters.

In fact, there are many NGOs (non-governmental organizations) specialized for some good cause. 
In this project, you'll have the chance to help one of them.

Choose an organisation who you'd like to help with a new website. 
Some of them already have great sites, this time, try to find one who lacks a site or has one,
but an old, not so useful one. If you cannot find such a website, you can also try to recreate an existing one.

## What are you going to learn?

- How to plan a landing page.
- How to create a wireframe.
- How to implement a whole website.
- Use CSS to build responsive websites.
- Build layouts.

## Tasks

1. Choose an NGO, which could use a better website and replan their page in a way that it clearly explains their cause  and the working of their organization and convince the visitor that the NGO is legit and trustworthy and it is worth supporting.

2. Like any real life project, an NGOs website should be also planned well.
    Acceptance criteria for this task to be considered done: 
    - There is a mid-fidelity wireframe created and saved in the repository (as an image)
    - Plan each NGO subpage. This can include:
        - Information about past project.
        - The NGO history.
        - The team, or current employees.
        - A contact page.
        - Anything else that makes sense for the given NGO.

3. You need to build the home page.
    - There is a `home.html` file that contains the HTML of the home page
    - A navigation bar contains links to the other pages 
    - A navigation bar contains a NGO logo in the left side, that when clicked leads to the home page
    - The main content contains information about the NGO, with images, text and a cool layout
    - There is a footer that contains the following links to contact (facebook, twitter, email), copyright and navigation in the page

4. Build at least three more pages, to describe the NGO.

5. You have great freedom on this project. Follow the linked articles on how a great landing page looks like and implement what is necessary for your chosen NGO to gain conversion.
    - There is a nice and clean landing page for the selected NGO

## General requirements

- Use only native HTML and CSS, no 3rd party stuff, nothing else
- All pages should be responsive look good on multiple laptop screens
- At least the homepage should be responsive and look good on both the desktop and mobile screens
- Files should be organized according to their purpose, in separate folders
- Proper git usage is REQUIRED. This means:
   - All code MUST be on the `main` branch of your repository
   - Multiple commits should be created, each with descriptive messages
- Code MUST be formatted properly, according to the [prettier](https://prettier.io/) rules. You can use the [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for this. You can even enable [format on save](https://blog.yogeshchavan.dev/automatically-format-code-on-file-save-in-visual-studio-code-using-prettier) from it

## Hints

- This project will be evaluated against four pillars:
    - _Visual style_. This includes how the application looks, how it responds to screen resolution changes, and how friendly and easy to use it is.
    - _Code correctiveness_. Is the code following the standards properly? Or is it just a mismash of things put there until it works.# Presentation site for an NGO
